## Troubleshooting

### Website Won't Track
- Make sure you granted permissions when prompted
- Some websites block automated access - try visiting the site manually first
- Local files (`file://`) and Chrome pages (`chrome://`) cannot be tracked

### Not Receiving Notifications
- Check that Chrome notifications are enabled for the extension
- Ensure the extension has proper permissions
- Try manually checking for updates first

### Extension Not Loading
